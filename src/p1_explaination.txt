The main structure used is the python OrderedDict, a normal python dictionary that store the order of keys insertion.
With this feature every time a key is used or inserted, it is pushed as last item of the ordered dictionary, in this way the first element is the last recently used element

Time complexity:
    - All operations have a complexity time of O(1) (as required)

Space complexity:
    - All operations have a space complexity of O(n) as depends on the dictionary dimension used as cache, where n is is the max elements that the cache could contain
