The blockchain conserve the list of blocks and the last appended block. In this way, to add a new block it doesn't need to iterate over all the linked list to check the validity of the new block.

Time complexity:
    - block_chain.add_block O(1) - The last block to get the hash to check is stored as attribute to speed up the process without iterate all the linked list

Space complexity:
    - block_chain.add_block O(1) - Is not needed extra data to store new block
