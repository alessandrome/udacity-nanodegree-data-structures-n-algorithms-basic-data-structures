For the union a dictionary is created to set all the values in the lists with the value as key and value: dictionary can not have duplicated keys!. From the list of values og the union dictionary,
iterating it from last element linked list is created using linked list prepend function to exploit O(1) of this operation over the O(n) complexity of a simple append method of the linked list!

For the intersection a dictionary is created to set all the values in the first list, then a dictionary is created to put in values of the second list, but only if the value is present as key in the first dictionary.
From the intersect dictionary, the same passages of union dictionary described above are used to transform dictionary in a linked list.

Time complexity:
    - Union O(n) - It simple iterate over the first list and the second list one time each
    - Intersect O(n) - As union iterate over the first list and the second list only one time

Space complexity:
    - Union O(n) - Max space used is the length sum of the two lists
    - Intersect O(n) - Max space used is the length of a list
